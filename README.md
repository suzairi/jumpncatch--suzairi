# Concept
The mini game is about avoiding the obstacle that comes from the right. One dodges by jumping. If you get hit, you lose. 
Besides, you have 3 lives. If you lose them all, it's called Game Over.
At the same time objects fall from above:
  + Coins - are collected as normal
  + Hearts - collect if you lose a life (fall down rarely)
  + Bomb - avoid (otherwise Game Over)
